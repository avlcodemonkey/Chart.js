### Bugs & issues
Please report these on the GitHub page - at <a href="https://github.com/avlcodemonkey/Chart.js" target="_blank">github.com/avlcodemonkey/Chart.js</a>. If you could include a link to a simple <a href="http://jsbin.com/" target="_blank">jsbin</a> or similar to demonstrate the issue, that'd be really helpful.


### Contributing
New contributions to the library are welcome, just a couple of guidelines:

- Spaces for indentation, not tabs please.
- Please ensure you're changing the individual files in `/src`, not the concatenated output in the `Chart.js` file in the root of the repo.
- Please check that your code will pass `jshint` code standards, `gulp jshint` will run this for you.
- Please keep pull requests concise, and document new functionality in the relevant `.md` file.
- Consider whether your changes are useful for all users, or if creating a Chart.js extension would be more appropriate.

### License
