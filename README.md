# Chart.js v1x

*Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element* 

This fork of Chart.js is based off of the 1.1.1 branch of the [original project](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/tree/v1.1.1). If you're looking for the standard version go to [chartjs.org](http://www.chartjs.org).

## v1.2.1 Bleeding-Edge

- Branch: [v1x](https://github.com/avlcodemonkey/Chart.js/tree/v1x)

This somewhat retro version is being tweaked to try to decrease the bundle size and to increase performance. 

Some features are being removed to accomplish that end:
- Animation
- Scale override

##### Contributing to 1.2.1

##### Building and Testing
